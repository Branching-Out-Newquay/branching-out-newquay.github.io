        <h1>Supporting</h1>
        <p>Branching Out wouldn't exist without our supporters and volunteers and we need even more help to reach everyone who can benefit from the club. Obviously, experienced coders and makers can help us run club events but there are lots of other ways to help if you have the time or resources. We can make good use of whatever you can offer.</p>
        <h2>Promoting</h2>
        People can't benefit from the club unless they know about it. We constantly need help with social media posts, content for this website, talking to potential members and supporters, gathering feedback and helping people to feel safe and welcome.
        <h2>Managing</h2>
        Club management is not too demanding but is easier if shared by a group of people. This involves sorting out the events calendar, dealing with enquiries and special requests, basic safeguarding procedures.
        <h2>Equipment and materials</h2>
        <p>We have a stock of basic things that people can borrow during club events. There is a little bit of effort needed for basic maintenance such as updating software but we also occasionally need to solder electronic components or carry out other minor repairs.</p>
        <p>We would like to have stock that we can loan out or pass on and we would like to be able to top up the small amounts of consumables we use (e.g. 3D printer filament). We would be happy to take donations from individual supporters but local companies and other organisations may also be able to help. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pi Pico ~£5</li>
            <li>micro:bit ~£15</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pi £15+</li>
            <li>LED strips/rings £10+</li>
            <li>Servos/Motors for robots ~£5</li>
            <li>Sensors and components ~£5</li>
            <li>Cables and connectors ~£5</li>
            <li>3D Printer Filament £10+</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        We are enormously grateful to the team at Newquay Orchard for hosting the club. We use laptops and other devices on loan from the Digital Inclusion team at Cornwall Council. We also use equipment and learning materials passed on from the TechCornwall community.
