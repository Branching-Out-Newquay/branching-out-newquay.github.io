        <h1>Coding</h1>
        <p>Come and use our computers to build your knowledge and skills. Whatever your experience we have something to offer. Maybe you have never tried coding before and are just curious. Maybe you are a professional coder looking for inspiration. Perhaps you are somewhere in between and want to learn more.</p>
        <h2>Beginner</h2>
        <p>Learn what coding means and how it can help people get things done. Get help and simple instructions to code your very first programme. Get creative making some digital artwork or a simple computer game. You will be surprised at what you can do.</p>
        <h2>Intermediate</h2>
        <p>Take what you already know and build new skills. Go deeper into the coding that you already know or try crossing over into something new. It could be a new coding language like Scratch, Python or C++. It could be progressing your own project such as a website (<a href=https://github.com/Branching-Out-Newquay/branching-out-newquay.github.io>like this one!</a>) or controlling things such as lights and motors.</p>
        <p>You'll probably want to keep your work so you can carry on <a href=/coding_hints_and_tips.html>at home</a> or at the next club event so a small, cheap USB memory stick would be good or we can help you find somewhere online to keep your work.</p>
        <h2>Advanced</h2>
        <p>Build out your skills into new areas. Try out coding and making 3D models. Design, assemble and code your own robot or digital art installation. Try your hand at supporting others and help them learn from your experience.</p>
